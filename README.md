As a member of the data science team, I have been tasked to analyse the air quality dataset and provide insights to the business. The data was collected from a multigas sensor array that was deployed in the field in an Italian city.
The data was collected between March 2004 and February 2005 (one year) representing the time in which the sensor was operated. The data was collected at an industrial location with high levels of pollution. 

Evidences of cross-sensitivities as well as both concept and sensor drifts are present as described in De Vito et al., Sens. And Act. B, Vol. 129,2,2008 (citation required) eventually affecting sensors concentration estimation capabilities.

I aim to develop a predictive model that uses the sensor readings and meteorological data to help city planners and health officials monitor and manage air quality more effectively.

The data was collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [air_quality_data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality)

Analyze the data and carry out predictive analysis to come up with conclusions and recommendations
